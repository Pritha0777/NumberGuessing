#This file gives a detailed documentation/explanation of the code

We import random to generate random numbers
We import time to create a sleep time between steps

1) Main
- Set playagain to "yes" by default 
- we create a while loop which starts the game only if "playagain" 
variable is set to "yes" or "y"
- We assign a random number between 1 and 200 using random.randint
- We get the name of user from "intro" function
- we assign the number and name as input variables to "pick" function
- once the player has played, we ask if the player wants to play again
- the answer is stored in playagain variable

2) Intro:
- We ask the user its name and store it in "name"
- We print the gist of game and return the name to main function.

3) Pick:
- Assign the guesses_taken = 0
- Only 6 tries are given to user, hence set the while loop for 6 loops
- In a try section, once the user enters the guess, the "guesses_taken" is increased by 1
- then we check if the guess entered is equal to, < or > the actual number
- if the guesses_taken is < 6, we ask them again.
- if the guess is correct or the guesses_taken >6, the loop breaks
- However if a number guessed is more than 200 or less than 1, we ask the
user to enter the number again.
- in except section, put a valueError to make sure the input is a number
- Lastly if the number is guessed right or wrong, print the output according to it
using if else statement
